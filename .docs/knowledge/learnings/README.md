# Learnings & Corrections

This directory captures important learnings and corrections discovered during planning and implementation.

## Format

Each learning entry should include:

```markdown
## [Date] - [Brief Title]

**Context:** [What were you working on?]
**Learning:** [What did you discover?]
**Impact:** [How does this affect future work?]
**Related:** [Link to PR, issue, or plan if applicable]
```

## When to Add

- User corrects an assumption
- Research reveals something unexpected
- Implementation differs from plan
- Recurring workaround needed

## Organization

Use topic-based files (e.g., `testing.md`, `wails-build.md`), not one giant file.
